LibPressio_Practice.cpp is a basic example program pulled from https://github.com/robertu94/libpressio_tutorial/blob/master/exercises/1_basics/cxx/basics.cc

I installed libpressio with spack. I am using the following command to compile the LibPressio_Practice.cpp file:
g++ LibPressio_Practice.cpp -I/home/kguerns/spack/opt/spack/linux-rocky8-x86_64/gcc-8.5.0/libpressio-0.99.4-vogxdiripvjmbqxetpr2tgc3aqak7mv7/include/libpressio -lpressio
